# Employee

This project is a complete Employee Management System created in angular. It contains Register/Login page, Employee List, Employee Detail, Add an Employee, Edit an Employee, Deleting an Employee. It also contains filtering, sorting, and paginating. It also applies some state of searching to localStorage as well as saving data to the cloud (firestore/firebase). So this project is a real world fullstack app.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Simple to start: `git clone <repo>` and go to directory app, run: `npm install`. Before running, execute: `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`. Finally run: `ng serve`
## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
